# GastosApp ðŸ’¸

Every time I tried to use Excel to track my monthly expenses, I failed miserably because I don't know (and honestly don't want to learn) Excel. 
So, instead of learning Excel like a normal person would, I'm building a trash app in React to get the job done.

## Tools

* React
* Shadcn/ui
* SQLite

## How to Run

For now, just run the next commands:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## ETA

I expect to finish this App around December as a side project. Then maybe I will consider to make it a webview to use it in mobile format.
